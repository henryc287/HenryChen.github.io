                <h2>About Henry</h2>
                <p1>
                    Hello, I'm Henry!
                </p1>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Toronto Metropolitan University's Master of Spatial Analysis program, researching deep learning models for noise prediction (concepts).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently advancing my research in Deep Learning Models for Noise Prediction, with a focus on developing cost-effective and scalable solutions that can be deployed in diverse 
                    environments, including resource-constrained settings such as third-world countries. My work involves the validation and refinement of these models through iterative testing and 
                    continuous updates, leveraging techniques such as transfer learning, lightweight architectures, and edge computing to ensure high performance without the need for expensive hardware or tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A key aspect of my research is designing models that are computationally efficient and capable of running on low-power devices, such as smartphones or IoT sensors, which are more accessible in 
                    developing regions. By optimizing the model's architecture and reducing its dependency on high-cost infrastructure, I aim to make advanced noise prediction technology affordable and widely 
                    deployable, even in areas with limited resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To achieve this, I am incorporating real-world data from diverse sources, including urban soundscapes and environmental recordings, to ensure the model's adaptability 
                    and generalizability across different contexts. I am also exploring the use of attention mechanisms and graph neural networks to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in noise patterns, 
                    which are critical for accurate predictions in complex environments. </p>
                <p>
                    The ultimate goal of this research is to contribute to the development of intelligent noise prediction systems that can be deployed in real-time applications, such as smart cities, 
                    autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation, while also addressing the unique challenges faced by third-world countries. By prioritizing accessibility and affordability, I aim to create a 
                    solution that not only improves quality of life and operational efficiency but also bridges the technological gap between developed and developing regions</p>
